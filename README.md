# air-quality-analysis
Jupyter notebooks and Python code for analyzing air quality (fine particles, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) 

## 1.Start from basic
- introduce to basic setup of folder, install `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (using `pip` for Python package), `Anaconda` is a good choice if you are using Windows (or even Mac, Linux). Alternatively, try out [**Google Colaboratory**](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- basic use of those tools (clean, explore, plot, interpret)
- work with a CSV file from [Airnow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/)
- here are some graphs produced from this exercise
  - basic line chart

## Credits:
- some of the writing and coding are carried out while I am working with [PAM Air](pamair.org) project.  I appreciate the flexiblity from the management so that I can make this happen.
