Jupyter notebooks and Python code for analyzing air quality (fine particle, PM2.5) 

## Start from basic
- introduce to basic setup of folder, install `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- basic use of those tools (using `pip`)
- work with a CSV file from [Airnow.gov](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/)
